description: How the MyTube API (NestJS, packages/api) is structured, how configuration, validation, DTOs and modules work, and the conventions for adding endpoints, services and background jobs. Read before touching packages/api or packages/shared.

# Backend

The API is NestJS 12 (ESM) in `packages/api`. Everything is served under the `/api` global prefix. In production it also serves the built web app from `packages/web/dist` with an SPA fallback, so there is one process and one port. See the tooling skill for commands.

## Layout

```
packages/api/src
  main.ts               bootstrap: global prefix, shutdown hooks, listen
  app.module.ts         root module; wires config, database, features, static files
  config/               AppConfig: env-derived paths, port, version (global module)
  database/             SQLite via Drizzle, SQL migrations (see database skill)
  common/               cross-cutting helpers such as ZodValidationPipe
  health/               example feature module (controller only)
packages/api/test       end-to-end tests booting the real AppModule
```

Feature modules go in `src/<feature>/` with `<feature>.module.ts`, `<feature>.controller.ts`, `<feature>.service.ts` and their specs next to them.

## Configuration

- `AppConfig` (`src/config/app-config.ts`) parses `process.env` with Zod. It only holds what must be known before the database exists: `HOST`, `PORT`, `CONFIG_DIR`, `MUSIC_DIR`, `VIDEO_DIR`, `WEB_DIST`, `APP_VERSION`.
- Everything a user can change in the Settings screen lives in the database (the `settings` table), never in env.
- Inject it by class: `constructor(private readonly config: AppConfig) {}`.

## DTOs and validation

- Request and response shapes are Zod schemas in `packages/shared/src`, exported from its `index.ts`. Export both the schema and the inferred type under the same name (`export const Thing = z.object(...); export type Thing = z.infer<typeof Thing>`).
- Validate input with `ZodValidationPipe` from `src/common`: `@Body(new ZodValidationPipe(CreateThing)) body: CreateThing`. Invalid input becomes a 400 with the Zod issues.
- Controllers return plain objects typed with the shared response type. The e2e test parses responses with the shared schema so drift fails the build.
- Do not use class-validator or class-transformer.

## Dependency injection notes

- Constructor injection by class works (decorator metadata is emitted by both `nest build` and Vitest).
- Interfaces and types used only as types must be imported with `import type`; classes used for injection must be value imports.
- Non-class providers use a `Symbol` token and `@Inject(TOKEN)`. The database is one: `@Inject(DATABASE) private readonly db: Database`.

## Background work

- Subscription checks and downloads run in-process. Use `@nestjs/schedule` for timers and a database-backed queue table for work items. No Redis, no external workers.
- yt-dlp is a binary the app downloads into `CONFIG_DIR` itself on first boot and updates periodically. It is not part of the image.

## Testing

- Unit test services and pure functions with Vitest next to the file.
- End-to-end tests in `packages/api/test` boot `AppModule` with `CONFIG_DIR` pointed at a temp dir (see `app.e2e.spec.ts`) and use supertest.
